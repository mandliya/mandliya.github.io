Hi, I’m Ravi — an endlessly curious professional passionate about technology, learning, and making an impact. I am a Machine Learning Enginer at Discord with a focus on recommendation systems and large-scale machine learning. My goal is to achieve technical mastery and contribute meaningfully to the field, pushing the boundaries of what AI can do.

In both my professional and personal life, I’m driven by a love for deep learning (in every sense of the word) and believe in hands-on, practical exploration. I am interested in learning about recommendation systems, multimodal AI systems, natural language processing, and the intersection of AI and human behavior.

When I’m not working, you can find me experimenting with new technologies, robotics, reading about the latest advancements in AI, or enjoying a good book. I’m always eager to connect with like-minded individuals, so feel free to reach out!
