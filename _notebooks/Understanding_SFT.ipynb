        "# Supervised Finetuning in LLM training workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "In this post we are going to explore the concept of Supervised Fine-tuning. When large language models are trained, they are rarely trained in a single monolithic step. Instead, they typically go through **three major steps**\n",
        "\n",
        "## Pretraining (Base Model)\n",
        "In this first step, model learns general language patterns from a huge, mostly unlabeled corpus (self-supervised learning). The objective is next-token prediction (causal language modeling). Data often comprises of a large chunk of internet (web text, book, code, blogs etc). This step gives us a base model is good at continuing text (predicts the most fitting next token), however it is not necessarily good at following instructions or being safe/helpful.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\n",
        "In this second step, model is taught to behave like a helpful assistant or task-specific model by imitating high-quality examples. On the top of base model, model is further trained on curated input-output pairs (prompt + desired answers). The objective is still next-token prediction. Data typically contains high quality instruction-response datasets, chat transcripts, code solutions, reasoning traces, domain-specific Q&A etc. This step gives us a instruction-tuned model that follows prompts much better than the raw base model.\n",
        "## Preference Optimization/Alignment (e.g. RLHF, DPO)\n",
        "In this third step, model is trained to make responses not just plausible but *preferred* according to human or synthetic preferences (helpfulness, harmlessness, style etc). The objective is to optimize for a loss that comes from a pairwise preference data or reward model, not direct next-token supervision. Data is usually human or model-generated comparisons like \"response A is better than response B for this prompt\". This step finally gives us a chat or *assistant* model that is safer, more on-task, and more user-aligned. This is what the final model we often experience when we interact with ChatGPT or Claude.\n",
        "\n",
        "SFT sits in the **middle** of this pipeline: it takes a broadly capable but unaligned base model and **steers it toward the behaviors we want**, before we do any preference‑based alignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "## SFT in detail\n",
        "\n",
        "Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is simply **standard supervised learning applied on top of a pretrained LLM**.\n",
        "- We freeze nothing (in the basic version): All or most model weights remain trainable.\n",
        "- We provide **labeled exmaples** in the form:\n",
        "  - *Prompt*: An instruction or input (e.g \"Explain the difference between BFS and DFS\").\n",
        "  - *Target output*: The detailed answer (e.g. A high-quality explanation written by a human or a stronger model).\n",
        "\n",
        "Formally, given a dataset of **N** instruction-response pairs $({(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})}_{i=1}^N)$, we optimize:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{SFT}}(\\theta)\n",
        "= - \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{t=1}^{T_i}\n",
        "\\log p_\\theta\\big(y^{(i)}_t \\,\\big|\\, x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}_{<t}\\big)\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "  - $x^{(i)}$ : The input prompt\n",
        "  - $y^{(i)}$ : The target response, treated as sequence of tokens.\n",
        "  - $p_\\theta$ : the same autoregressive language model used in pretraining, now fine‑tuned on these supervised pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In gist:\n",
        "- **Same architecture, new data**: SFT doesn't change the model architecture, it only changes the data and sometimes the sampling of sequences (e.g. packing prompts + answers in one context).\n",
        "- **Behavior shaping**: Since the model is explicitly shown \"here is the right way to respond to this kind of instruction\", it learns to format the answers, follow instructions, and stay on topic.\n",
        "- **Foundation for alignment**: RLHF/DPO and other alignment techniques usually start **from** an SFT-tuned model (there are some exceptions though e.g. Deepseek) rather than the raw base model, because SFT already teaches basic assistant like behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "In rest of this post, we will practically implement supervised fine-tuning for our fictional use case."
