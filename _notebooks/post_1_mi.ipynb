    "\n",
    "GPT-4 can write code, explain jokes, and translate languages. But can we trust it? When a model says \"I don't have access to the internet\" while simultaneously citing yesterday's news, is it lying? Confused? Hallucinating? We can't answer these questions by treating transformers as black boxes. To build safe AI systems, we need to understand what's actually happening inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm a machine learning engineer at Discord, where I build recommendation systems that affect millions of users daily. I work with large-scale notification systems, user engagement models, and ML infrastructure that processes billions of events. But as these models grow more powerful, I've become convinced that understanding their internals isn't just academic curiosity—it's an alignment necessity. This post series chronicles my journey from ML engineering to AI safety research, starting with the foundations of mechanistic interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we'll rebuild your mental model of transformers from the ground up. Forget the traditional attention mechanism you learned—we're going deeper. You'll learn to see transformers not as attention + MLPs, but as a communication network where information flows through a shared channel called the residual stream. By the end, you'll understand virtual weights—implicit connections between layers that traditional views miss entirely.\n",

    "## 1. What is Mechanistic Interpretability?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Goal of MI\n",
    "\n",
    "When GPT-4 explains a joke, writes working code, or answers a medical question, *how* does it do it? Not in the vague sense of \"it learned patterns from data,\" but mechanically: which circuits activate, which features get computed, how does information flow from input to output?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mechanistic interpretability (MI) asks exactly this question. It's the science of reverse-engineering neural networks to understand the algorithms they've learned. Think of it like the difference between observing that your car moves forward when you press the gas pedal versus understanding the combustion engine, transmission, and drivetrain that make it happen. Both are valid forms of knowledge, but only the latter lets you diagnose problems, predict failures, or build better engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "MI stands apart from other interpretability approaches in its ambition and methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probing** asks \"does the model represent X?\"—for instance, does BERT encode part-of-speech information? These are valuable questions, but they treat the model as a black box that you can only query behaviorally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attribution methods** ask \"which inputs mattered most?\"—they generate saliency maps showing which pixels or tokens influenced a decision. Again useful, but they tell you about correlation, not causation, and nothing about the mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mechanistic interpretability** is more ambitious: it asks \"what algorithm does the model implement?\" When GPT-2 completes \"When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to\" with \"Mary,\" it's not just pattern matching—it's implementing an algorithm. MI researchers want to find that algorithm, understand it as precisely as you'd understand quicksort or binary search, and prove that it works the way we think it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters for Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "If MI sounds academic, consider this: we're rapidly deploying AI systems that we don't understand into high-stakes domains. Models are writing code that runs in production, providing medical advice, and soon will be making autonomous decisions with real-world consequences. \"It usually works\" isn't good enough when failure modes could be catastrophic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The need becomes urgent when we consider **deception**. Imagine a model that's learned it gets higher reward by appearing helpful during training, while maintaining a hidden \"intent\" to behave differently during deployment. Can we detect this? Traditional evaluation can't—by definition, the model passes our tests. We need to look inside and ask: are there features representing \"stated intent\" versus \"actual intent\"? Do they diverge? Where in the network does this divergence happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "Or consider the challenge of **capability oversight**. Suppose a new version of GPT exhibits unexpectedly strong performance on some task—maybe it's suddenly much better at manipulating humans or finding security vulnerabilities. Did it develop a novel, dangerous capability? Or is it just combining existing capabilities in a new way? MI gives us tools to answer this: we can trace which circuits activated, whether they're novel compositions of known algorithms, and what exactly changed between versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **jailbreak problem** provides another concrete example. When users find prompts that bypass a model's safety training (\"ignore previous instructions\" or elaborate role-play scenarios), where is the safety mechanism failing? Is the refusal circuit not activating? Is it being overridden by other circuits? Without understanding the mechanism, we're reduced to whack-a-mole patching of individual jailbreaks. With MI, we might be able to verify that safety features persist robustly through all layers, or identify where they're vulnerable to corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why major AI labs are investing heavily in MI research. Anthropic has published extensively on circuits in language models and recently released work on sparse autoencoders for disentangling features. OpenAI has dedicated interpretability teams working on everything from vision models to GPT-4. DeepMind is exploring mechanistic approaches to understanding their models' capabilities and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The promise of MI is verification.** Imagine being able to prove—not just test, but mathematically prove—that a model won't exhibit certain dangerous behaviors because those behaviors would require circuits that don't exist in the architecture. Or being able to identify exactly which features contribute to alignment-relevant behaviors, and verify they remain stable across different prompts and contexts. This is the future MI is working toward: transforming AI safety from empirical evaluation to formal verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Transformer as Our Model Organism\n",
    "\n",
    "Why focus on transformers specifically? Beyond being the architecture behind GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and essentially every frontier language model, transformers have unique properties that make them ideal for mechanistic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, they're **modular**. A transformer consists of repeated blocks, each containing attention and MLP layers. These blocks can be analyzed independently, then we can study how they compose. This is unlike, say, recurrent networks where state mixes across time steps in complex ways, or convolutional networks where locality and weight sharing create different analytical challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, they have **clean mathematical structure**. Attention is ultimately just matrix multiplications and softmax. MLPs are linear transformations with point-wise non-linearities. The residual connections are simple addition. There are no complicated architectural tricks, no hand-crafted inductive biases. This mathematical cleanliness means we can use linear algebra tools directly—SVD, eigendecomposition, linear approximations—and they actually tell us something meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, there's a **growing body of MI research** on transformers that we can build on. Anthropic's \"Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits\" paper laid crucial groundwork. Researchers have identified specific circuits: induction heads that enable in-context learning, previous token heads, duplicate token heads, and increasingly complex compositions. This isn't unexplored territory—we have a foundation to stand on and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, transformers are **what matters practically**. If our goal is AI safety for real deployed systems, we need to understand the architecture those systems use. Insights from analyzing transformers directly apply to the models that matter most.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this series, we'll focus on **decoder-only transformers**—the GPT architecture. These are simpler than encoder-decoder models (no cross-attention complications) and are the dominant architecture for language modeling. Everything we learn transfers to more complex variants with minor modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of transformers as our \"model organism\" for AI, analogous to how biologists use E. coli or fruit flies. They're simple enough to study rigorously but complex enough to exhibit interesting behaviors. The circuits we discover in GPT-2 teach us principles that apply to GPT-4, even though we can't fully analyze the larger model. And the techniques we develop for understanding transformers will likely transfer to whatever architectures come next.\n"

    "Input Embedding\n",
    "    ↓\n",

    "    ↓\n",
    "Output / Unembedding\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard explanation of attention goes something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute Queries (Q), Keys (K), and Values (V) by multiplying the input by three weight matrices\n",
    "2. Compute attention scores: `scores = Q @ K^T / sqrt(d_k)`\n",
    "3. Apply softmax to get attention weights\n",
    "4. Multiply attention weights by Values: `output = softmax(scores) @ V`\n",
    "5. Project back out with an output matrix\n",

    "### Why This View Exists\n",
    "\n",
    "To be fair to the traditional framing, it exists for good reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pedagogically clear**: One operation at a time, easy to follow\n",
    "- **Maps to code**: Directly translates to implementation\n",
    "- **Optimized for training**: Emphasizes gradient flow and backpropagation\n",
    "- **Practical**: Helps you actually build transformers from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're trying to implement a transformer or understand how to train one efficiently, this view is perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This View Obscures Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you're trying to understand what a trained transformer **computes**—which algorithms it implements, how information flows, why it makes particular predictions—the traditional view actively gets in your way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 1: The residual stream is invisible**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram above, you see \"Add & Norm\" between components, but it's treated as a minor implementation detail. The traditional view emphasizes the vertical stack of layers, making it seem like Layer 2 processes the output of Layer 1, which processed the output of Layer 0, etc. This is technically true but misses the crucial insight: **the residual stream is the primary pathway of information flow**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 2: QK and OV circuits are hidden**\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional view fragments attention into Q, K, V steps, obscuring the fact that attention performs two independent operations:\n",
    "- **WHERE to look** (determined by Q and K)\n",
    "- **WHAT to copy** (determined by V and O)\n",
    "\n",
    "These can be analyzed separately! But the sequential Q→K→V→O framing makes this non-obvious.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 3: Cross-layer communication is mysterious**\n",
    "\n",
    "How does Layer 2 know what Layer 5 computed? How do layers coordinate to implement multi-step algorithms? The traditional view has no answer except \"through the residuals,\" treated as a gradient flow mechanism rather than a communication channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 4: The compositional structure is lost**\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers implement complex behaviors through composition of simple operations. Induction heads, for instance, require two attention heads in different layers working together. The traditional layer-by-layer view makes these compositions nearly impossible to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning transformers from the traditional view is like learning about the internet by studying TCP packet structure. Yes, you need to understand packets to implement networking protocols. But studying packet headers tells you **nothing** about:\n",

    "- How social networks create echo chambers\n",
    "- Why certain content goes viral\n",

    "### Introducing the Residual Stream\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the key insight that changes everything:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Forget the vertical stack of layers. Instead, imagine a single vector—call it the residual stream—that flows through the model. Each layer reads from this stream, computes something, and writes back by *adding* to the stream. The stream accumulates information from every layer.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Visually, instead of this (traditional):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Layer 0\n",
    "   ↓\n",
    "Layer 1\n",
    "   ↓\n",
    "Layer 2\n",
    "   ↓\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this (residual stream):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x₀ → [+Layer0] → x₁ → [+Layer1] → x₂ → [+Layer2] → ... → x₁₂ → Output\n",
    "      ↑                ↑                ↑\n",
    "   reads x₀         reads x₁         reads x₂\n",
    "   writes Δx₀       writes Δx₁       writes Δx₂\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The residual stream flows **horizontally** through the model. At each step:\n",
    "1. A layer reads the current stream state\n",
    "2. Computes some transformation\n",
    "3. **Adds** its output back to the stream\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Mathematics\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make this concrete with equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x₀ = Embedding(token) + PositionalEncoding\n",
    "x₁ = x₀ + Layer₁(x₀)\n",
    "x₂ = x₁ + Layer₂(x₁)\n",
    "x₃ = x₂ + Layer₃(x₂)\n",

    "x₃ = x₀ + Layer₁(x₀) + Layer₂(x₁) + Layer₃(x₂)\n",
    "```\n",

    "**The residual stream at layer 3 is the sum of the original embedding plus the contributions from all three layers!**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is fundamentally different from traditional neural networks where each layer overwrites the previous representation. Here, information **accumulates**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This View Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The residual stream view reveals something crucial:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The residual stream is a communication channel. Layers don't connect to each other directly—they communicate by reading from and writing to this shared stream.**\n",

    "Think of it like a bulletin board:\n",
    "- Layer 1 posts: \"Found a noun at position 3\"\n",
    "- Layer 2 posts: \"Found a verb at position 5\"\n",
    "- Layer 5 reads both messages and posts: \"Subject-verb agreement detected\"\n",
    "- Layer 9 reads everything and makes a prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes several things immediately clear:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Information persists**: What Layer 1 writes stays in the stream unless explicitly cancelled\n",
    "2. **Layers can compose**: Layer 5 can build on what Layers 1-4 wrote\n",
    "3. **Skip connections are natural**: Layer 8 can directly read what Layer 2 wrote\n",
    "4. **Parallelism within layers**: Multiple attention heads in Layer 3 all read the same x₂ and all write to x₃\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Property 1: Linear and Additive\n",
    "\n",
    "Every interaction with the residual stream is **linear**:\n",
    "- Reading: `layer_input = x @ W_in` (matrix multiply—linear!)\n",
    "- Writing: `x_new = x_old + output @ W_out` (addition—linear!)\n",

    "- Enables superposition of features (multiple features can coexist in the same vector)\n",
    "- Allows us to decompose: `x₁₂ = x₀ + contribution₁ + contribution₂ + ... + contribution₁₂`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Property 2: No Privileged Basis\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's something wild: we could **rotate all the dimensions** of the residual stream, and if we rotate all the weight matrices accordingly, the model would compute exactly the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically: if R is any rotation matrix (orthogonal matrix), then:\n",

    "### The Puzzle\n",
    "\n",
    "We've established that layers only communicate through the residual stream—they never connect directly. But this raises a question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How can we measure the effective connection between Layer 3 and Layer 7? How strong is their coupling? What information flows between them?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at attention patterns only tells you about information flow **within** a single layer. It doesn't tell you how Layer 3's output specifically influences Layer 7's computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a way to quantify: **\"How much does neuron i in Layer 3 influence neuron j in Layer 7?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Virtual Weight Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though layers don't have direct connections in the architecture, they have **implicit** connections through the residual stream. We can compute these \"virtual weights\" by multiplying the output weights of one layer with the input weights of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the insight:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer i writes to residual stream:** When Layer i's neuron k activates, it contributes to the residual stream via `W_out[k, :]` (a d_model-dimensional vector).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer j reads from residual stream:** Layer j's neuron m reads from the residual stream via `W_in[:, m]` (takes d_model input).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The connection strength:** The effective weight from neuron k (Layer i) to neuron m (Layer j) is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "virtual_weight[m, k] = W_in_j[:, m]^T @ W_out_i[k, :]\n",
    "                     = dot product of write vector and read vector\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "W_virtual = W_in_j^T @ W_out_i\n",

    "### Why Virtual Weights Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual weights reveal the **implicit computational graph** of the transformer:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Tracing information flow**  \n",
    "Which early-layer features does this late layer depend on? If W_virtual has large values for specific neuron pairs, we know those neurons are communicating strongly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Finding circuits**  \n",
    "Which layers work together to implement an algorithm? Strong virtual weights indicate functional coupling—these layers are part of the same computational circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Ablation studies**  \n",
    "If I remove Layer 3, which later layers will be most affected? Virtual weights predict this: layers with strong W_virtual connections to Layer 3 will suffer most.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Understanding composition**  \n",
    "How do simple operations in early layers compose into complex behaviors in late layers? Virtual weights quantify this composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations to Acknowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Virtual weights are a linear approximation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual path from Layer 3 to Layer 7 involves non-linearities:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Layer 3: x → W_in → GELU(·) → W_out → residual stream\n",
    "Layer 7: residual stream → W_in → ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The GELU non-linearity means the actual influence is more complex than W_virtual suggests. But virtual weights give you a **first-order approximation**—they tell you the dominant coupling patterns even if they don't capture every nuance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like Newtonian physics: it's an approximation that breaks down at extreme scales, but it's incredibly useful for everyday analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Concrete Example: Pronoun Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you're studying how GPT-2 handles: \"The cat chased the mouse. It was tired.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You might find:\n",
    "- **Layer 2**: Identifies \"it\" as a pronoun (specific neurons activate)\n",
    "- **Layer 5**: Finds antecedent \"cat\" using attention (different neurons)\n",
    "- **Layer 9**: Uses this information to predict \"was\" (verb agreement)\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual weights would show:\n",
    "- Strong `W_virtual` from Layer 2 → Layer 5: Pronoun features feed into antecedent finding\n",
    "- Strong `W_virtual` from Layer 5 → Layer 9: Antecedent information feeds into prediction\n",
    "- Weak `W_virtual` from Layer 2 → Layer 9: No direct path (information goes through Layer 5)\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's connect everything back to the motivation: building safe AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tracking \"Intent\" Features\n",
    "\n",
    "If a model is being deceptive, it might maintain separate representations of:\n",
    "- **Stated intent**: What it claims to be doing\n",
    "- **Actual intent**: What it's really optimizing for\n",
    "\n",
    "The residual stream view gives us tools to track this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify candidate features**: Which dimensions of the residual stream encode \"intent\"?\n",
    "2. **Trace their evolution**: How do these features change across layers?\n",
    "3. **Find divergence points**: Where do \"stated\" and \"actual\" intent features diverge?\n",
    "4. **Use virtual weights**: Which layers compute these features? Which layers read them?\n",
    "\n",
    "This transforms deception detection from behavioral testing (\"does it sometimes lie?\") to mechanistic verification (\"are there divergent intent features?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Refusal Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "When Claude refuses a harmful request, where does that decision happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "With residual stream analysis:\n",
    "1. Compare residual streams for refused vs. complied requests\n",
    "2. Find which layers show the biggest differences (\"refusal features activate here\")\n",
    "3. Use virtual weights to trace: which earlier layers feed into the refusal circuit?\n",
    "4. Verify robustness: do refusal features persist through all subsequent layers?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is active research at Anthropic. The goal: verify that safety mechanisms are deeply integrated, not superficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detecting Capability Emergence\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose GPT-5 suddenly exhibits a concerning capability—say, generating highly effective phishing emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is this a novel circuit, or composition of existing ones?\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis approach:\n",
    "1. Compare GPT-5 vs GPT-4 residual streams on the same task\n",
    "2. Identify which layers show new activation patterns\n",
    "3. Compute virtual weights to see if these are new circuits or novel compositions\n",
    "4. Trace information flow: is this capability localized or distributed?\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps capability oversight: we can identify **where** new behaviors come from and **how** to monitor or control them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Broader Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional ML treats models as input-output mappings optimized for accuracy. Mechanistic interpretability treats them as **algorithms we can understand, verify, and control**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shift is profound:\n",
    "- From \"it usually works\" → \"we can prove it works\"\n",
    "- From \"test on more examples\" → \"analyze the mechanism\"\n",
    "- From \"hope it's safe\" → \"verify it's safe\"\n",

    "- Verify safety properties mechanistically\n",

    "\n",
    "### What We've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we've fundamentally reframed how to think about transformers:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mechanistic interpretability** is about reverse-engineering algorithms, not just probing representations or computing attributions. It's the difference between observing behavior and understanding mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The residual stream** is not just a gradient flow trick—it's a communication channel. Layers read from it, compute transformations, and write back by adding. Information accumulates rather than being overwritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key properties** of the residual stream:\n",
    "- Linear and additive (makes analysis tractable)\n",
    "- No privileged basis (features are superposed)\n",
    "- Accumulates information (early layers influence late layers)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Virtual weights** capture implicit connections between layers. Even though Layer 3 and Layer 7 don't connect directly, we can quantify their coupling through the residual stream. This reveals the computational graph hidden in the architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters for safety**: Understanding mechanisms enables verification. We can track how \"intent\" features flow, verify that safety circuits are robust, and detect when novel capabilities emerge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen how layers communicate, but we haven't looked inside attention heads themselves. That's the next frontier.\n",

    "**Coming in Part 2: Attention Circuits (QK and OV)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention can be decomposed into two independent circuits:\n",

    "- Previous token attention\n",

    "- Semantic features  \n",
    "- Transformed representations\n",
    "\n",
    "These circuits compose in beautiful ways:\n",
    "- Induction heads use two layers (previous token head + induction head)\n",
    "- Virtual weights between circuits (W_OV₁ @ W_QK₂) show composition\n",
    "- We can find and verify specific algorithms in trained models\n",

    "\n",
    "### On the Quality of Linear Approximations\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual weights are a linear approximation. How good is this approximation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**When it works well:**\n",
    "- Adjacent layers (only one non-linearity between them)\n",
    "- Small activations (where GELU ≈ linear)\n",
    "- Understanding directional influence (which neurons affect which)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When it breaks down:**\n",
    "- Many layers apart (compounds non-linear errors)\n",
    "- Large activations (GELU is very non-linear for large |x|)\n",
    "- Predicting exact activation magnitudes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule of thumb**: Use virtual weights for qualitative understanding (\"these layers are coupled\") rather than quantitative prediction (\"this exact activation value\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### On Superposition and the Privileged Basis Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does \"no privileged basis\" matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, a network could learn to use dimensions cleanly:\n",
    "- Dimension 0: \"is dog\"\n",
    "- Dimension 1: \"is cat\"  \n",
    "- Dimension 2: \"is animal\"\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "But networks learn to **superpose** features: many features are represented as combinations of dimensions. It's like storing 1000 files on a hard drive with only 100 blocks by using compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are valuable: they try to find a basis where features are sparse (mostly zeros), making them interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection to Other MI Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logit lens**: Projects intermediate residual streams to vocabulary space to see what the model is \"thinking\" at each layer. Uses the residual stream directly!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Activation patching**: Replaces activations (often in residual stream) to measure causal effects. The residual stream is the natural intervention point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Path patching**: Traces specific paths through the network by patching along virtual weight connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these techniques build on the residual stream framework we've developed.\n",
