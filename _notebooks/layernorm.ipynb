    "## Introduction\n",
    "Training deep neural networks can be very challenging, not because of the complexity of the models, but because of how unstable the training process can be. One of the key reasons for this instability is the **internal covariate shift**, which refers to the change in the distribution of network activations due to updates in the parameters during training."
